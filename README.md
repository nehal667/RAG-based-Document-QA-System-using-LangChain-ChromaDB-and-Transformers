# RAG-based-Document-QA-System-using-LangChain-ChromaDB-and-Transformers
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to ask questions based on uploaded documents. It uses LangChain for orchestration, ChromaDB for vector storage, HuggingFace Transformers for question answering, and Gradio for a simple UI interface.
